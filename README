Included in this directory are the following
1. vv-app.R this is the file contains the UI and Server for The Variance Visualizer web app.
2. parsepileup.R this file contains the helper functions for parseing pileup files and creating SVGs, this file is used by vv-app.R
3. pileups-by-species this directory contains 25 pileup files from 7 different species which can be used as test data
4. its1, its2 & 58s these directories contain the same information as the pileups-by-species but split up into the 3 sections of the ITS region, ITS1 5.8S and ITS2
5. Dockerfile this is a docker file for creating an image with all dependencies needed to run BWA, Samtools and all the R dependances for VV. Currently the enviroment is built, but actually accessing the app from outside the docker container is not possible due to complications with mapping port numbers.
6. pileup-spliter.py this is the script used to split the pileup files from pileups-by-species into the subsetted files fround in the its1, its2 and 58s directories.

To run the app from the command line execute the following command
R -e "shiny::runApp('vv-app.R')"
After starting an ip address for your localhost and the chosen port number will appear, copy and past that into the browser view the app.
Alternatively you can open vv-app.R in RStudio and just click the Run App button in the top right of the screen
Or best option just visit: https://michael-bradshaw.shinyapps.io/variance_visualizer/
Note, the above URL will not be up forever since I only have a limit amount of free run time left
